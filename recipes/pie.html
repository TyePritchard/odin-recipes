    <h1>The best Apple pie you will ever make</h1>
    <p> <em>I used to be a total Apple Pie hater. It's always too mushy and bland. But no longer! I’ve found the perfect method to make the Best Homemade Apple Pie of your life! This classic recipe has a double crust (you won’t miss that crumble), a cooked filling for the best texture and flavor, and is super easy. I’ll show you how to make it from scratch!
